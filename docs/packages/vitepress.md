# VitePress Integration

You don't need explicit integration in [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) as VitePress already uses Shikiji under the hood.

VitePress provides [a few options for customizing Shikiji](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/src/node/markdown/markdown.ts#L66-L112). Learn more about them in the [VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.dev/reference/site-config#markdown).
